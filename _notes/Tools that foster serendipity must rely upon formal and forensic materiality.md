For tools intended to aid in the creation of serendipitous moments, we must consider their formal and [[forensic materiality]]. The formal elements are important because they allow us to interact with a text through a specific paradigm. The analog [[Zettelkasten]] uses the analogy of a card catalogue to aid users in sorting through its content. At the same time, it's forensic materiality—the specific way that data is stored and organized—more closely resembles a database with a flat hierarchy. This matters, because while the outward appearances are familiar, the inward affordances of the tool are such that information can be worked in a new way.

In the case of a digital tool such as [[Roam Research]], the [[formal materiality]] is very similar to a word processor or document outliner, complete with bullet points and the ability to re-arrange specific blocks of information. However, again, this is all built atop a database in which every block can be referenced from any other block. So, again, the forensic materiality differs from our understanding of how other word processors or outliners function.
