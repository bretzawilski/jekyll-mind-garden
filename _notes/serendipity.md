“Indeed, there are two key aspects to serendipity, only the first of which is its accidental nature and the delight and surprise of something unexpected (e.g., the synthesis of copper phthalocyanine). The second is the breakthrough or discovery made by drawing an unexpected connection – the sagacity (e.g., using copper phthalocyanine as dye).” ([André et al., 2009, p. 305](zotero://select/library/items/YK3TTMXN))

    - "Indeed, ==there are two key aspects to [[serendipity]]==, only the first of which is its accidental nature and the delight and surprise  of  something  unexpected  (e.g.,  the  synthesis  of copper phthalocyanine). ==The** second is the breakthrough or discovery made by drawing an unexpected connection** – the [[sagacity]] (e.g., using copper phthalocyanine as dye).== (Page 1)"
        - Accidental encountering. Act of drawing an unexpected connection.
    - "Serendipity”  is  a  term  that  was  coined  by  Horace  Walpole  in reference  to  a  fairy  tale,  “The  Three  Princes  of  Serendip.”  He described the three princes as going on adventures in which they were  “always  making  discoveries,  by  accidents  and  sagacity, of  things  they  were  not  in  quest  of”  (Serendipity,  n.d.). (Page 2)"
    - Can be simplified as an accident plus sagacity. Accidentally encounter something and have the wisdom (ecologically and materially mediated) to make a connection based on that accident.[[Article - Of Historicity Rhetoric - The Archive as Scene of Invention]]

- Dimensions of serendipity::
    - From [[Article - Measuring the Dimensions of Serendipity in Digital Environments]]
        - "Major takeaway from the article is a distilled list of "five core dimensions of [[serendipity]] that are present in digital environments""
            - "Enabled connections"
                - "bisociation describes "a creative association made between two disparate pieces of information or skills" (Koestler 1964)"
            - "Encountered the unexpected"
                - "In order for serendipity to arise, there must be some unanticipated information present that leads to the serendipitous experience. "
                - "Evnrionments that create opportunities for viewing or juxtaposing divergent materials may prime individuals for serendipitous moments."
                    - "Again do search algorithms like Google render these moments less probable? Does this concern the lack of venturing beyond the first few search result pages?"
            - "Presented variety"
                - "I'd accidentally grouped some of this with the above dimension. But this requires that search tools provide various materials occupying different genres or topics. Lack of variety would theoretically kill serendipity."
            - "Triggered divergence"
                - "So..an ability to make sense of an ongoing flood of information that may be viewed as "chance" happenings. "
                - "Basically being able to theorize a reason on the spot for why certain odd information is showing up. "
                - "Is this something about digital texts or is this a capacity that is housed by a person?"
            - "Induced curiosity"
                - "There must be a desire to understand material being presented, especially when it might not align with expectations. "
                - "Learning is active, and serendipitous moments require active attention to process, otherwise it would be easy to consider information irrelevant rather than serendipitously beneficial."
        - Björneborn (2008) in a study on serendipity in physical spaces. Haven't read the article, but read synthesis in [[Article - Measuring the Dimensions of Serendipity in Digital Environments]]
            "Not all are applicable to digital contexts, but many are."
