# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten are a form of information technology, and can be translated from the German as "slip notes," referring to the tendency to use Zettelkasten as a filing system for short, [[atomic notes]].

While there are multiple examples of Zettelkasten, one of the most prominent examples is the system constructed by sociologist [[The Niklas Luhmann Card Index|Niklas Luhmann]].

A wooden filing box with two kinds of notes. Literature notes or summaries of bibliographic references. Permanent notes, which are primary ideas or statements that can be grouped together by similarity.
